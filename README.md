# Exercism
These are completed exercises from [exercism.org](https://www.exercism.org/). Exercism provides exercises (with the option of code review) to help its users learn how to program/improve their programming skills. 

These are simple exercises, not large projects. Those will be forthcoming- most of my practice lately has been in work-related repositories.

As of now, I have enrolled in 3 tracks:
- R
- Python
- Java
